                We are a couple of students from Denmark, who made this project as part of an exam.
            Our whole idea with the project, is to use plastic recycled from the ocean,
            to create new wonderful products - you get some flyers and a poster along with your
            purchase if you buy in bulk, also you get a discount (an example of a poster is shown right here). If you want to buy in bulk,
            go to our contact page, and send us a message regarding which products you want
            and how many.
                <br><br>
            We got started with this whole project after we discovered how dire the situation
            is in regards to the oceans; not only are we consuming microplastics through our
            drinking water and fish, but even worse we are destroying marine life, making it
            increasingly hard for some species to live in the oceans.
